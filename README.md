### HUD 

- [HUD User Web Store](http://webstore.huduser.org/catalog/index.php)

> HUD USER currently offers nearly 800 housing related titles available via the HUD USER Document Ordering System.

- [HUD GSE Mortgage Data](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/gse/gse2007.html)

> GSE mortgage data supply mortgage lenders, planners, researchers, and housing advocates with a wealth of information concerning the flow of mortgage credit and capital in America's communities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to meet specified goals for purchases of mortgages that finance housing for very low-, low- and moderate-income families and families living in areas traditionally underserved by the mortgage market.

- [USPS Vacant Address Data](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/usps.html)

> HUD has entered into an agreement with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to receive quarterly aggregate data on addresses identified by the USPS as having been "vacant" or "No-Stat" in the previous quarter. HUD is making these data available for researchers and practitioners to explore their potential utility for tracking neighborhood change on a quarterly basis. The potential power of these data is that they represent the universe of all addresses in the United States and are updated every three months. Under the current agreement with the USPS, **HUD can make the data accessible only to governmental entities and non-profit organizations registered as users.**

### FFIEC ()

> Once the HMDA data are final, the FFIEC posts the data and the various data products to the FFIEC HMDA website (www.ffiec.gov/hmda). **HMDA data for a new year generally become available by September of the year following the calendar year (CY) of the data.** Data through CY 2010 are now available. The HMDA data products are discussed below, including a description, various formats, and availability.

 - Where is the data from after 2010?

- [FFIEC Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/)

> The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) was enacted by Congress in 1975 and was implemented by the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation C. **On July 21, 2011, the rule-writing authority of Regulation C was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Regulation C, requires lending institutions to report public loan data.**

- [FFIEC HMDA Data Products](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/hmdaproducts.htm)

 - There are a lot of different datasets available on this page.

> **Aggregate Reports**
> The HMDA Aggregate Reports, which are sorted by MSA/MD, aggregates the mortgage and home improvement lending information within an MSA/MD, regardless of whether the institution has a home or branch office in that MSA/MD.  The PMIC Aggregate Reports aggregate the mortgage insurance application data within an MSA/MD. 

> **Disclosure Reports**
> The HMDA Disclosure Reports summarize mortgage and home improvement lending information from data that are prepared yearly by individual institutions.  The PMIC Disclosure Reports summarize mortgage insurance application data from information that are prepared yearly by private mortgage insurance companies.  For 1996 and years thereafter, a supplemental report discloses data for property located outside of MSA/MDs in which the institution has a home or branch office.


- [National Technical Information Service (NTIS)](http://www.ntis.gov/products/publications.aspx)
 - A section of Department of Commerce; seems to have interesting data and publications, but all cost money, and none are downloadable from the web. 
 - [NTIS HMDA data portal](http://www.ntis.gov/products/bank-hmda.aspx), annual datasets run around $400 (NOT open data).




- [Neighborhood Nexus Data Sources](http://www.neighborhoodnexus.org/content/data-sources)
 - Seems like a good resource for finding other data sets, etc.
