#### HUD's Office of Inspector General [Federal Housing Admin. Audits of Citi, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Ally, Bank of America](http://www.hudoig.gov/reports/featured_reports.php)

 > As part of the Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) nationwide effort to review the foreclosure practices of the five largest Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage servicers (Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank, CitiMortgage, JP Morgan Chase, and Ally Financial, Incorporated) we reviewed Wells Fargo’s foreclosure and claims processes. In addition to this memorandum, OIG issued separate memorandums for each of the other four reviews. OIG performed these reviews due to reported allegations made in the fall of 2010 that national mortgage servicers were engaged in widespread questionable foreclosure practices involving the use of foreclosure “mills” and a practice known as “robosigning” of sworn documents in thousands of foreclosures throughout the United States.

# Data Resources

## Federal Reserve Bank of New York

#### [Household Credit Reports](http://www.newyorkfed.org/creditconditions/index.html)
 - has state and county level data, but their source is Equifax
 > *Only counties with an estimated population of at least 10,000 consumers with credit reports in 2010Q4 were included in these tables. The figures in these tables are based on the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel which constitutes a 5% random sample of the US population of individuals who have credit reports with Equifax.

## Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)

####[FinCEN Mortgage Fraud SAR Datasets](http://www.fincen.gov/mlf_sar_data/)

## HUD 

#### [HUD Neighborhood-level Foreclosure Data](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/nsp_foreclosure_data.html)

**Note:** See [HUD's methodology paper on this dataset](https://github.com/hrwgc/homes/blob/gh-pages/read/hud-nsp-methodology-paper.pdf) here

#### [Public Housing Agency (PHA) Inventory](https://explore.data.gov/Construction-and-Housing/Public-Housing-Agency-PHA-Inventory/3n2v-xk7d)
 > The dataset contains current data on low rent and Section 8 units in PHA's administered by HUD. The Section 8 Rental Voucher Program increases affordable housing choices for very low-income households by allowing families to choose privately owned rental housing. Through the Section 8 Rental Voucher Program, the administering housing authority issues a voucher to an income-qualified household, which then finds a unit to rent. If the unit meets the Section 8 quality standards, the PHA then pays the landlord the amount equal to the difference between 30 percent of the tenant's adjusted income (or 10 percent of the gross income or the portion of welfare assistance designated for housing) and the PHA-determined payment standard for the area. The rent must be reasonable compared with similar unassisted units.

#### [American Housing Survey - 2009](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/ahs/ahsdata09.html)

 > The data from the 2009 American Housing Survey and the documentation about the survey are available on this page. We have the instrument items booklets, which are human-readable documents listing all of the items in the survey instruments, and we have a runnable copy of the 2009 computerized interviewing instrument itself.

#### [HUD User Web Store](http://webstore.huduser.org/catalog/index.php)

 > HUD USER currently offers nearly 800 housing related titles available via the HUD USER Document Ordering System.

#### [HUD GSE Mortgage Data](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/gse/gse2007.html)

 > GSE mortgage data supply mortgage lenders, planners, researchers, and housing advocates with a wealth of information concerning the flow of mortgage credit and capital in America's communities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to meet specified goals for purchases of mortgages that finance housing for very low-, low- and moderate-income families and families living in areas traditionally underserved by the mortgage market.

#### [HUD Data Reference Guide](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/otherHUDdata.html)

#### [USPS Vacant Address Data](http://www.huduser.org/portal/datasets/usps.html)

 > HUD has entered into an agreement with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to receive quarterly aggregate data on addresses identified by the USPS as having been "vacant" or "No-Stat" in the previous quarter. HUD is making these data available for researchers and practitioners to explore their potential utility for tracking neighborhood change on a quarterly basis. The potential power of these data is that they represent the universe of all addresses in the United States and are updated every three months. Under the current agreement with the USPS, **HUD can make the data accessible only to governmental entities and non-profit organizations registered as users.**

## Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)

 > Once the HMDA data are final, the FFIEC posts the data and the various data products to the FFIEC HMDA website (www.ffiec.gov/hmda). **HMDA data for a new year generally become available by September of the year following the calendar year (CY) of the data.** Data through CY 2010 are now available. The HMDA data products are discussed below, including a description, various formats, and availability.

 - Where is the data from after 2010?

#### [FFIEC Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/)

 > The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) was enacted by Congress in 1975 and was implemented by the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation C. **On July 21, 2011, the rule-writing authority of Regulation C was transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Regulation C, requires lending institutions to report public loan data.**

#### [Guide to HDMA Reporting for Mortgage Institutions](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/guide.htm)
 > The Guide is a valuable resource for assisting all institutions in their HMDA reporting. It provides a summary of responsibilities and requirements, directions for assembling the necessary tools, and step-by-step instructions for reporting HMDA data.

#### Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: [HMDA: What the Public has right to see and why](http://www.occ.gov/static/community-affairs/community-developments-newsletter/summer05/cd/hmdadisclosure.htm)

#### [FFIEC HMDA Data Products](http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda/hmdaproducts.htm)

 - There are a lot of different datasets available on this page.

 > **Aggregate Reports**
 > The HMDA Aggregate Reports, which are sorted by MSA/MD, aggregates the mortgage and home improvement lending information within an MSA/MD, regardless of whether the institution has a home or branch office in that MSA/MD.  The PMIC Aggregate Reports aggregate the mortgage insurance application data within an MSA/MD. 

 > **Disclosure Reports**
 > The HMDA Disclosure Reports summarize mortgage and home improvement lending information from data that are prepared yearly by individual institutions.  The PMIC Disclosure Reports summarize mortgage insurance application data from information that are prepared yearly by private mortgage insurance companies.  For 1996 and years thereafter, a supplemental report discloses data for property located outside of MSA/MDs in which the institution has a home or branch office.

 > **Loan Application Register (LAR) & Transmittal Sheet (TS) 

 > The HMDA LAR and TS data are collected by a financial institution as a result of applications for, and originations and purchases of, home-purchase loans (including refinances) and home-improvement loans for each calendar year. The 2010 HMDA LAR data total over 16.3 million records and 7,923 TSs.
The PMIC LAR and TS data include information on applications for mortgage insurance to insure home purchase mortgages and to insure mortgages to refinance existing obligations. The PMIC raw data are available in the same formats as the HMDA data.


#### [National Technical Information Service (NTIS)](http://www.ntis.gov/products/publications.aspx)
 - A section of Department of Commerce; seems to have interesting data and publications, but all cost money, and none are downloadable from the web. 
 - [NTIS HMDA data portal](http://www.ntis.gov/products/bank-hmda.aspx), annual datasets run around $400 (NOT open data).
