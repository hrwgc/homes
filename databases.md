 > Data sets on single-family and multifamily mortgage purchases in 2010 by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the Enterprises) are now available from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) in the Public Use Database (PUDB).  Mortgage data in the PUDB supply mortgage lenders, planners, researchers, and housing advocates with information concerning the flow of mortgage credit and capital in Americaâ€™s communities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are required to meet specified goals for purchases of mortgages that finance housing for very low- and low-income families and families living in low-income areas. 
 > FHFA releases the PUDB annually in compliance with Section 1323 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (Safety and Soundness Act), as amended, based on loan-level mortgage data submitted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
