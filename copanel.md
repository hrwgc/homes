### GAO - June 2010: "FORECLOSURE MITIGATION - Agencies Could Improve Effectiveness of Federal Efforts with Additional Data Collection and Analysis"

> To supplement these data sources, we also analyzed loan-level servicing data we obtained from CoreLogic to examine the volume, characteristics, and performance of loan modifications made through both federal and nonfederal programs. The data we obtained provide wide coverage of the national mortgage market—that is, approximately 65 percent to 70 percent of prime loans and about 50 percent of subprime loans, according to CoreLogic officials. (p. 79)

> **Due to the proprietary nature of CoreLogic’s estimates of its market coverage, we could not directly assess the reliability of these estimates. However, we have used CoreLogic data in prior reports in which we concluded that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.** 
>
> Nevertheless, because of limitations in the coverage and completeness of the data, our analysis may not be representative of the mortgage market as a whole. CoreLogic’s prime loans include conventional loans as well as loans insured or guaranteed by FHA, VA, and other government entities. Further, prime loans include near prime or Alt-A loans.4 For each mortgage, the CoreLogic database
>
> To examine the volume, characteristics, and performance of loan modifications, we took a 15 percent random sample of the CoreLogic data set, which resulted in 7,608,603 prime mortgages and 608,704 subprime mortgages. Although this data set did not contain direct information about the presence of modifications, we developed a set of algorithms to infer if the loan had been modified. We confirmed the accuracy of our algorithms by using our methodology to analyze data provided by OCC that included known modifications (see app. III). We conducted several analyses on this data set. For example, we calculated the magnitude of payment reductions as well as the 6-month redefault rates for modified loans.
> 
> 2 The HOPE NOW estimates are from a survey of HOPE NOW members, which include approximately 37 million loans and have been extrapolated to the entire first-lien industry. HOPE NOW reports data on HAMP modifications and “proprietary modifications.” According to a HOPE NOW official, the proprietary modifications in their survey include modifications completed under Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA programs, as well as modifications completed on loans held in lenders’ portfolios or in private label securities. 
> 
> To estimate the total number of permanent loan modifications through servicers’ proprietary efforts, we subtracted the modifications completed under federal agencies and the enterprises (as reported by the federal agencies and the enterprises) from the total modifications estimated by HOPE NOW. The OCC data on foreclosure mitigation efforts are based on loan-level data submitted by nine large servicers—which are: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, HSBC, MetLife, PNC, U.S. Bank, Wells Fargo, and OneWest Bank—that OCC estimated represent about 60 percent of all first lien residential mortgages outstanding.


## Congressional Oversight Panel p 11

> There are four major private sources that track mortgage delin- quencies, foreclosures, and loss mitigation efforts, but their cov- erage is either limited or of questionable reliability. Two private subscription sources, First American LoanPerformance and McDash, feature loan-level data and are considered to be reliable sources with sufficiently detailed data for meaningful analysis about factors driving mortgage defaults, but these sources have limited market coverage. LoanPerformance collects loan perform- ance data, including foreclosures, from the trustees of securitized private label pools. LoanPerformance supposedly covers over 80 percent of the subprime market, but has more limited coverage of prime loans.29 McDash collects data from mortgage servicers for both securitized and portfolio loans and is supposed to cover be-

> 29 See Vanessa G. Perry, The Dearth and Life of Subprime Mortgage Data: An Overview of Data Sources for Market Modeling (Jan. 8, 2008) (online at www.hoyt.org/subprime/vperry.pdf).

> In addition to these sources, there is the Mortgage Bankers Asso- ciation’s quarterly National Delinquency Survey, which is data that is estimated to cover 80–85 percent of the market.32 The MBA’s NDS tracks defaults and foreclosures, but does not have the granu- larity to support meaningful analysis about factors fueling defaults and it does not contain any data on loss mitigation efforts. Addi- tionally, **RealtyTrac** publishes a monthly U.S. Foreclosure Market Report, which tracks foreclosures, not delinquencies or loss mitiga- tion efforts. 

> *RealtyTrac’s report is based on court filings and does not include information about the specific characteristics of loans. Moreover, RealtyTrac’s methodology overstates the number of unique properties in foreclosure because it measures foreclosure filings, and there can be multiple filings for an individual property. Moreover, many foreclosures that are initiated result in cure and reinstatement, a workout, a short sale, or a deed in lieu.* RealtyTrac also tracks completed foreclosure sales, although it does not publish these numbers, but these are a more reliable indicator of foreclosure activity, albeit with a significant delay.

> Several government agencies track mortgage delinquencies, fore- closures, and loss mitigation efforts, but only for limited segments of the market. 

> **No federal agency tracks foreclosures for the entire market.33**

> Several federal agencies subscribe to the McDash and LoanPerformance databases. Additionally, in the Treasury Depart- ment, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision have recently begun using an expanded version of the McDash data service to jointly track foreclosures in the serv- icing portfolios of fourteen national banks and federal thrifts, which combine for around 60 percent of the total mortgage servic- ing market. OCC and OTS have begun to publish a quarterly Mort- gage Metrics Report, detailing some of its analysis of foreclosure mitigation efforts. The Mortgage Metrics Report, however, is still a work in progress. Its first two editions lacked data about many crucial issues. OCC and OTS have announced that the March and June editions will include expanded data and analysis, which the Panel applauds. 

### *But the Panel notes that this expansion in data collection has come about only following the Panel’s request for in- formation in the form of the COP Mortgage Data Survey. While the Panel is pleased to see the expanded data collection, the data collection efforts that are beginning today are ones that should have been implemented by the agencies months, if not years ago.*

p. 13

> **The result is that no comprehensive private or government source exists for accurately tracking loan delinquencies and loss mitigation efforts, including foreclosures and modifications, on a complete, national scale.** No federal agency has the ability to track delinquencies accurately and loss mitigation efforts for anything more than 60 percent of the market. The existing data are plagued by inconsistencies in data collection methodologies and reporting, and are often simply unverifiable. Worse still, the data being col- lected are often not what is needed for answering key questions, namely what are causing mortgage defaults and why loan modifications have not been working.36


### Relationship to HMDA 

(p.15)

> Thus, the Panel believes that Congress should create a national mortgage loan performance reporting re- quirement applicable to banking institutions and others who serv- ice mortgage loans, to provide a source of comprehensive intel- ligence about loan performance, loss mitigation efforts and fore- closure, that federal banking or housing regulators would be man- dated to analyze and share with the public. Such a reporting re- quirement exists for new mortgage loan originations under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Because lenders already report de- linquency and foreclosure data to credit reporting bureaus, the ad- ditional cost of federal reporting should be small.

## **NOTE:** What is HOPE NOW? Their [March 2012 report][7] states:

> HOPE NOW data is extrapolated based on the "MBA Delinquency Survey" for Q1-2012. MBA estimates that its survey covers approximately 88% of 
the total industry. HOPE NOW data estimates for April 2012 may increase or decrease slightly when the MBA releases its Delinquency Survey data for 
Q2-2012.

And their [State Loss Mitigation Survey for April 2012][8]

> "Survey data may be restated from time to time based on servicers' collection and reporting. HOPE NOW reports State data as provided by servicers to a third-party data aggregation vendor. Data changes will generally be reflected in monthly reporting except for changes prior to the current year."

What is Hope Now?
[Members][9]
Meta description: "HOPE NOW is an alliance between HUD approved counseling agents, servicers, investors and other mortgage market participants that provides free foreclosure prevention assistance."

> The private sector also has developed and offered programs at no cost to help distressed homeowners. HUD-approved counseling agents, mortgage companies, investors, and other mortgage market participants created the HOPE NOW Alliance (Hope Now) to provide homeowners with free foreclosure prevention assistance. Consumers can visit Hope Now’s website, www.hopenow.com, or call the Homeowner’s HOPE Hotline, 1-888-995-HOPE, to find housing counselors from HUD-certified agencies who can help guide them through various foreclosure prevention options, including loan modification.
